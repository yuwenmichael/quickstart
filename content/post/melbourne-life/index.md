## Being a volunteer at Brotherhood of St. Laurence March 2021 - July 2022
I have been volunteered at Brotherhood of St. Laurence for one and a half year since the beginning of 2021. At first, I just want to complete the [Leaders in Communities Award](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/careers/get-career-ready/leadership-and-employability-programs/leaders-in-communities-award-lica). After completing 40 hours of volunteerring in 4 months, I find that being a volunteer is pretty fun. I can meet lots of different people with different cultural background and experience things that I never experienced before. Thus, I stay there till July 2022.
