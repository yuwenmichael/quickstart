You don't need to convince everyone that you are pretty, happy, perfect and you are living a good life. You are just yourself and that's already enough.

Hey, just let them judge you. Let them misunderstand you. Let them gossip about you. Their opinions aren't your problem. You stay kind, committed to love and be free in your own authenticity. No matter what they say or do, don't you dare doubt yourself. Just keep shining like you do now.

{{< quote source="unknown">}}
You said that I shouldn't be trapped under the small patch of sky, that I should stand higher and look further, and to see what the world is really like. Now I'm standing on top of the mountain, wild field, extravagent amount of lights of this starry night. All of the charm and temptations of the entire world are beneath my eyes, but none of them really matters. I still desire you.
