{{< quote source="David Nicholls, One Day">}}
“What are you going to do with your life?" In one way or another it seemed that people had been asking her this forever; teachers, her parents, friends at three in the morning, but the question had never seemed this pressing and still she was no nearer an answer... "Live each day as if it's your last', that was the conventional advice, but really, who had the energy for that? What if it rained or you felt a bit glandy? It just wasn't practical. Better by far to be good and courageous and bold and to make difference. Not change the world exactly, but the bit around you. Cherish your friends, stay true to your principles, live passionately and fully and well. Experience new things. Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance.”

“You're gorgeous, you old hag, and if I could give you just one gift for the rest of your life it would be this. Confidence. It would be the gift of condidence. Either that or a scented candle.”

{{< quote source="Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre">}}
“Do you think I am an automaton? — a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal — as we are!”

"What makes life valuable is that it doesn't last forever. What makes it precious is that it ends. To remind us that time is luck. So don't waste it living someone else's life. Mkae yourself count for something. Fight for what matters to you. No matter what. Because even if we fall short, what better way is there to live?"

I always say that you have to guard against the downside. Don't let a deal like that take you down if it doesn't work.

{{< quote source="unknown">}}
You said that I shouldn't be trapped under the small patch of sky, that I should stand higher and look further, and to see what the world is really like. Now I'm standing on top of the mountain, wild field, extravagent amount of lights of this starry night. All of the charm and temptations of the entire world are beneath my eyes, but none of them really matters. I still desire you.
